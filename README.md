## Getting Started with local dev

> All steps below are based on the use of [pipenv](https://pipenv.kennethreitz.org/en/latest/)
>
>- on mac: `> brew install pipenv`
>
> The github actions still require a `requirements.txt` file so if you add
> anything to the `Pipfile` you will need to generate a new `requirements.txt` file
>
>- `> pipenv run pipenv_to_requirements -f`

- `> pipenv install --dev`
- `> pipenv shell`
    - start a shell with a virtual environment
- Build the site
    - `#> mkdocs build`
- install markdown linter
    - `> npm install -g markdownlint-cli`
- run the linter before commits
    - `> markdownlint -c .markdownlint.json .`
