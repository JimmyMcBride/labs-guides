# Overview

These guides will provide guidance that Labs teams working in Lambda X
can use to accomplish various tasks. Adherence to these standards are
critical to the continued success of the Lambda X organization, as they
allow us to more effectively manage the scores of teams working across hundreds
of products.

## Guides

The guides will be devided into separate categories. A category corresponds
to a specific area of concern in the engineering standards. The categories
can all be viewed in the menu at the top of the page.

## Completeness

These guides do not cover all possibilities. Many are purposely omitted
so as to require the individuals and teams in Labs to discover their own
solutions.

When in doubt, please open an issue or submit a PR to start a discussion.

## Contributing

These guides will morph over time as we adapt to the ever-changing technology
landscape. In addition, the guides will embrace a subset of all of aspects
of the Labs experience, so that teams have some general guidance. In order
to ensure that these guides are inclusive of the needs of all Labs groups,
each new standard or change to an existing standard will be ratified by
approval from 3 Labs Tech Leads.
